## Technologies Used
- SpriteKit

## Overview
A 2D scrolling maze game where you avoid obstacles to move upwards to escape death, which will eventually happen if you get dragged to the bottom of the screeen by the scrolling of the maze. 

## Instructions
- Use arrow keys to move
- Step on spinning stars to collect points
- Descending to the bottom of the screen = death
- Moving 4 blocks without collision grants you superpower
- Superpower: faster movement, one chance to break a wall block
- You lose your superpower when you collide with an obstacle
- Spinning pentagonal traps: if you're caught by them, they stun you and that counts as a collision
Enjoy!
